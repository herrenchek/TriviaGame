# LoTR Trivia
A Lord of the Rings themed multiple choice trivia game using JavaScript for the logic and jQuery to manipulate HTML. The player is given a limited amount of time to complete the quiz. The game ends when the timer runs out or when the player submits the form. The page will reveal the number of questions that players answer correctly and incorrectly. Play the trivia game [here](https://herrenchek.github.io/TriviaGame/). It's responsive, so it works on mobile too!
